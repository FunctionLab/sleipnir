 * \brief Utilities for sending and receiving data over the network
 *
 * This class provides static utility functions to facilitate the exchange of messages between the Seek
 * client and the Seek server. In order to allow this exchange to occur, all messages
 * must conform to a uniform standard.
 *
 * On the sending end, all outgoing messages must first begin with a message header that specifies the
 * length and the type of the message. Then the body of the message follows.
 *
 * The supported outgoing messages are: an array of \c chars (such as a \c string), an array of \c floats.
 * The outgoing message is structured as follows:
 * \li Byte #1-4: An \c unsigned \c integer that specifies the size of one element (\a S). (1 for a \c char, 4 for a \c float)
 * \li Byte #5-8: An \c unsigned \c integer that specifies the total number of elements to be sent (\a N). (1 for a single-value,
 * otherwise the size of the array)
 * \li Byte #9 and onward: \a S times \a N bytes specifying the array content
 *
 * On the receiving end, CSeekNetwork also supports the receiving of a \c char array (or a \c string) or a \c float array.
 *
 * In order to be properly recognized, the incoming message should be structured as follows:
 *
 * For a \c char array:
 * \li Byte #1-4: A \c signed \c integer that specifies the length of the \c char array to receive (\a NC)
 * \li Byte #5 and onward: \a NC bytes specifying the \c char array.
 *
 * For a \c float array:
 * \li Byte #1-4: A \c signed \c integer that specifies the length of the \c float array to receive (\a NF)
 * \li Byte #5 and onward: \a NF times 4 bytes specifying the \c float array.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * <b>
 * Outgoing messages are always encoded using bytes in the Little Endian order.
 *
 * For an incoming message to be properly recognized, the message should also be encoded with bytes in the Little Endian order.
 * </b>
