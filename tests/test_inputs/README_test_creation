1) Choose a subset of PCL files to use for the test. For example the breast-cancer example from the Seek website
2) Create a go.gmt file that has groups of correlated genes for the example PCL files
3) Assemble the set of genes that will be used. For example all go genes in the human_go.gmt
4) Create the set of queries that will comprise the test
    > python bioinform_tests/pytools/create_queries.py -max 1000 -c 8,12,16,20,25 -i human_cancer_slim.gmt -o queries
5) Run the queries with known-good SeekMiner tool
    > python bioinform_tests/pytools/test_seek_querysizes.py -s test_outputs/sampleBC/ -b ../Debug/ -g test_outputs/queries4/ -o test_outputs/results -v
