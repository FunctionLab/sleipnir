 * \page BNTester BNTester
 * 
 * BNTester evaluates arbitrarily structured Bayesian networks to produce predicted probabilities of
 * functional relationship; these networks are often learned with \ref BNConverter.
 * 
 * \section sec_overview Overview
 * 
 * Although \ref BNConverter can perform some limited evaluation on the Bayesian networks it learns,
 * BNTester is the primary tool for performing Bayesian inference on arbitrary network structures.
 * Like \ref BNConverter, BNTester can handle networks with complex structure, unobserved (hidden) nodes,
 * or continuous values.
 * 
 * Bayesian integration generally entails assigning one Bayesian network node to each available biological
 * dataset.  Groups of related datasets (e.g. all physical binding datasets) can be collected under a
 * single unobserved "parent" node, and the network is capped by a single Functional Relationship (FR)
 * node representing whether a particular observation (e.g. gene pair) is functionally related.  This
 * process is detailed in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12826619">Troyanskaya et al 2003</a>.
 * 
 * Given such a network (usually as a <a href="http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/">SMILE</a> DSL or XDSL file) with
 * reasonable parameter values and a collection of discretized biological datasets (usually Sleipnir::CDat s
 * stored as DAT or DAB files with associated QUANT files), BNTester will infer probabilities of functional
 * relationship for (optionally) all gene pairs in the genome.  This can be used to evaluate performance for
 * known related/unrelated gene pairs or to predict function and/or functional relationships for
 * uncharacterized genes/gene pairs.
 * 
 * For example, consider the Bayesian network used in
 * <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16420673">Myers et al 2005</a>, which we'll assume we've
 * saved as \c biopixie_learned.xdsl with reasonable parameter values (either learned or assigned manually):
 * \image html bn_pixie.png
 * The name of each node is displayed, and SMILE associated an ID with each name; this might be \c FR for
 * FunctionalRelationship, \c COREGULATION for Coregulation, \c MICROARRAY for Microarray Correlation, and
 * so forth.  Each leaf node corresponds to a single dataset, and each non-leaf node is an unobserved
 * (hidden) and has no associated dataset.  To evaluate this network, we should assemble a directory of data
 * files:
 * \code
 * MICROARRAY.dab
 * MICROARRAY.quant
 * TF.dab
 * TF.quant
 * CUR_COMPLEX.dab
 * CUR_COMPLEX.quant
 * ...
 * SYNL_TRAD.dab
 * SYNL_TRAD.quant
 * \endcode
 * Each data file is a Sleipnir::CDat, either a DAT or a DAB, containing experimental results.  Each QUANT
 * file describes how to discretize that data for use with the Bayesian network (the number of bins in the
 * QUANT must be the same as the number of values taken by the corresponding node in the Bayesian network).
 * Once we've placed all of these files in a directory (e.g. \c ./data/), we can perform Bayesian inference
 * to evaluate the network:
 * \code
 * BNTester -d ./data/ -i biopixie_learned.xdsl -o predicted_relationships.dab
 * \endcode
 * The \c predicted_relationships.dab file now containins a Sleipnir::CDat in which each pairwise score
 * represents a probability of functional relationship, and it can be mined with tools such as \ref Dat2Dab
 * or \ref Dat2Graph.
 * 
 * \section sec_usage Usage
 * 
 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * BNConverter -d <data_dir> -i <network.xdsl> -o <learned.xdsl> -w <answers.dab> -t <frac>
 *		-e <test_predictions.dab> -E <train_predictions.dab>
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Saves learned parameters for the network \c network.xdsl in the new network \c learned.xdsl, based on
 * the data in \c data_dir (containing files with names corresponding to the network node IDs) and the
 * functional gold standard in \c answers.dab.  Hold \c frac fraction of the gene pairs out of training; store
 * predicted probabilities of functional relationship for these pairs in \c test_predictions.dab and the
 * remaining inferred probabilities in \c train_predictions.dab.
