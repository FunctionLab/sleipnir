 * \page Funcifier Funcifier
 * 
 * Funcifier (pronounced funk-if-eyer, not fun-siffier, with flagrant disregard for rules of standard
 * English) calculates the strength of functional association between processes or pathways in a given
 * functional relationship (or data) network.  A functional association between two gene sets (e.g. pathways)
 * measures the amount of cross-talk between those processes, which is calculated from the given individual
 * gene pair functional relationships.

 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * Funcifier -i <network.dab> -o <functions.dab> -l <colors.txt> <contexts.txt>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Find the strength of functional association between every pair of contexts \c contexts.txt in the
 * functional relationship network \c network.dab and store the resulting function pair network in
 * \c functions.dab; if requested, output the cohesiveness score for each function in \c colors.txt for
 * use with \ref Dat2Graph.
