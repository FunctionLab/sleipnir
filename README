Overview:
Sleipnir is a C++ library enabling efficient analysis, integration, mining, and machine learning over genomic data. This includes a particular focus on microarrays, since they make up the bulk of available data for many organisms, but Sleipnir can also integrate a wide variety of other data types, from pairwise physical interactions to sequence similarity or shared transcription factor binding sites.

The file README.developer has notes for Sleipnir developers.

Sleipnir also includes the code to compile SEEK (the human coexpression search engine). See the link http://seek.princeton.edu/installation.jsp for information on its installation.

Code:
The latest version of Sleipnir software can be obtained
by issuing the following command:

git clone https://github.com/FunctionLab/sleipnir.git

Build:
1. Install g++, cmake

2. install libraries
> brew install libsvm
> brew install libomp

3. Clone repository
> git clone https://github.com/FunctionLab/sleipnir.git
> cd sleipnir
> git submodule init
> git submodule update

4. Using cmake
> mkdir Debug
> cd Debug
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

4.2 (On Mac) - Edit sleipnir/src/libsvm.h
Replace:
#include <libsvm/svm.h>
With:
#include <svm.h>

5. Build the code
> make
In case of errors:
> make clean
> make VERBOSE=1

6. Run the unit tests
> Debug/tests/unit_tests

7. Run Seek system tests
> cd scripts/seek
> conda env create --file conda_environment.yml
> conda activate genomics
> python -m pytest -s -v tests/
